### Overview

The project focuses on identifying the key factors that influence whether a person purchases a bike. This analysis can be used for business intelligence, marketing strategies, and customer segmentation.

### Dataset

The dataset consists of several sheets with different types of information:

1. **bike_buyers**:
   - Core data about individuals, including demographics (age, gender, income), marital status, education, commute distance, and whether they purchased a bike.
2. **WorkingSheet**:
   - A refined version of the bike_buyers dataset, enriched with additional columns like age brackets to categorize customers further.
3. **PivotTable**:
   - Summarized data showing average income by gender and purchase status, useful for high-level insights.
4. **Dashboard**:
   - A placeholder for a visual dashboard that provides an overview of key metrics.

### Analysis

The analysis investigates:

- The impact of income, age, and marital status on bike purchases.
- Gender differences in purchase patterns.
- Commuting distance and its correlation with bike ownership.

### Usage

1. Download the file.
2. Open the project in your preferred data analysis tool (e.g., Excel, Python, R, etc.).
3. Review the dataset and analysis steps.

### Future Work

- Enhance the dashboard with interactive visualizations.
- Build predictive models using machine learning to forecast purchases.
- Add external data (e.g., weather conditions, traffic) to improve the analysis.
